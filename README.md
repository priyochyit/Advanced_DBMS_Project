Project Title: "An Intelligent Web-Based Banking Ledger System with Blockchain-Inspired Security".

This repository contains the advanced frontend interface for the Automated Digital Management System (ADMS). The system is designed for high-security banking environments, specifically modeled for a central banking context, featuring an immutable-style ledger and real-time risk evaluation aesthetics.

📖 Project Overview
The ADMS Frontend is a high-performance, responsive web interface built to demonstrate an immutable banking ledger. It utilizes cryptographic concepts, such as SHA-256 blockchain hashing, to ensure transaction integrity through visual data chaining.

Key Features
Blockchain-Inspired Security: Cryptographic chaining simulation for transaction integrity.

Intelligent Risk Engine: Integrated UI for autonomous financial risk assessment.

Secure Portal: Multi-role authentication (User/Staff) with a modern, glassmorphic design.

Regional Branch Directory: Interactive branch switching with dynamic map integration.

Real-time System Notices: Live tracker for maintenance schedules and security updates.

🛠️ Tech Stack
The project is built using modern web technologies focused on performance and aesthetic precision:

HTML5: Semantic structure for financial data.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling for a sleek, "Dark Mode" fintech aesthetic.

JavaScript (ES6+): Dynamic DOM manipulation for tab switching, branch selection, and UI state management.

Google Fonts: Inter-variable font for high legibility.

🚀 Installation & Usage
